#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n): The algorithm loops over n and increments a based on n. This is a linear process based on n

b)
O(n squared) - O of n squared - for each element n, we will need repeat the while loop until j is equal to n. This require n to essentially be repeated for every n, leading to big O of n squared

c)
O(n): Once again, the recursion depends on n counts of bunnies, so will be a linear process, so big O of n

## Exercise II
